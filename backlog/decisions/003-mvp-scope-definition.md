# Decision: MVP Scope and Feature Prioritization

## Status
**Approved**

## Date
2024-08-21

## Context
Based on the PRD analysis and technical constraints, we need to define the MVP scope that can be delivered in 16 weeks with a team of 9 people and achieve product-market fit with initial users.

## Decision
**Implement core habit-tracking mechanics with basic social features, deferring advanced gamification and ML-powered features to post-MVP phases.**

## MVP Scope (Weeks 1-16)

### Must Have (P0)
1. **Core Journey System**
   - 100-day journey creation and tracking
   - Daily workout logging (timer, quick log, photo)
   - 100-day grid visualization
   - Basic streak tracking
   - Offline support for core features

2. **Basic Social Layer**
   - Partner matching (simple algorithm)
   - Partner nudges (pre-defined messages)
   - Basic squad formation (5-8 members)

3. **Essential Gamification**
   - 5 core badges (Day 1, Week 1, Day 30, Day 66, Day 100)
   - Simple identity score
   - Phase transitions (visual only)

4. **Critical Compliance**
   - Health disclaimers
   - Age verification (18+)
   - Basic terms of service
   - GDPR-compliant data handling

### Should Have (P1) - Add if ahead of schedule
- Extended badge system (10+ badges)
- Squad challenges
- Basic leaderboards
- Email notifications

### Won't Have (P2) - Post-MVP
- ML-powered predictions
- Smart interventions
- Advanced analytics
- Mentor matching
- Corporate partnerships
- Multiple journey types
- Content moderation AI

## Rationale
1. **Focus on Core Value**: Habit formation through accountability
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Can be built with current team in 16 weeks
3. **User Validation**: Test core hypothesis before scaling features
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Defer expensive features (ML, AI) until revenue validated

## Success Criteria
- 1,000 users registered in first month
- 40% Day 30 retention
- 4.0+ app store rating
- <$1,000 infrastructure cost/month

## Development Phases
- **Weeks 1-4**: Core journey mechanics
- **Weeks 5-8**: Social features
- **Weeks 9-12**: Gamification and polish
- **Weeks 13-16**: Testing, bug fixes, launch prep

## Post-MVP Roadmap
- **Phase 2 (Month 4-6)**: Advanced social, full gamification
- **Phase 3 (Month 7-9)**: ML/AI features, analytics
- **Phase 4 (Month 10-12)**: Scale features, corporate program

## Review Triggers
- User feedback indicating missing critical features
- Competitor launches with advanced features
- Faster than expected development velocity
- Funding secured for acceleration
